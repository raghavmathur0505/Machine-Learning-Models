# ID3 Algorithm -Machine Learning 

Project description

Technology: Java

About:
1) Implemented ID 3 algorithm to create a Decision Tree model and classify data for predictive analysis
2) Applied an object-oriented approach to create the classification model, while using Information Gain of attributes to predict data while enhancing decision-making process by effective feature selection and inductive inference 

Running the Code:
1) Open Command prompt and give the path of the file followed by [javac testDecisionTree.java] command.
2) Then run the file by [java testDecisionTree] command.
