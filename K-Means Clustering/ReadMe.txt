
Part I
Implemented the k-means algorithm using Euclidean distance on a dataset with two attributes. The dataset is available for download at: http://www.utdallas.edu/~axn112530/cs6375/unsupervised/test_data.txt

Part II

Computed the similarity between tweets using the Jaccard Distance metric and Clustered tweets using the K-means clustering algorithm.
	
Part III:

Used k-means unsupervised learning to reduce the number of color points in an image. This application is also referred to as image segmentation or color quantization.
